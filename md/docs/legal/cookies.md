It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

# What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Overcast Community) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website. The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.

# Why do you use cookies?

We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some first party cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate under its intended means, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other first party cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Site for analytics purposes.

# How can I control cookies?

Managing your cookies and cookie preferences must be done from within your browser's options/preferences.
